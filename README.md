seer2arff
=========

Converts the SEER data set to an ARFF compatible format for use in the Weka
data mining suite.

This is an utility to assist in converting the SEER data set, which I am using
for a research project.  It will currently output only patients who are stage
IV and who have died from cancer, how it is undergoing development... ;)

If you think this could help you, don't hesitate to contact me (www.datko.net).
